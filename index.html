                Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion
                and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however
                learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any
                experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered
                educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Intelligence is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.[58] This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.[59] Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.
